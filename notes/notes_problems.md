# Notes (5-13-22)

## Problems 

1. or_clean is shoing NA values for the following coloumns: Population, cases_per_pop, and deaths_per_pop. 

2. reactable doesn't work in web browser. 

3. might need to break up files into smaller files. 

## Additions 

1. add columns for "new" (cases, deaths, vecc, part_vacc). 

2. Hypothesis test: 

    Question: The time to subdue cases spikes has decreased. 
    
    $H_0 = \text{no significant difference in time to recover from spikes}$
    
    $H_1 = \text{significant difference in time to recover from spike}$

3. peek at quantmod trends?
